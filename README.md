Hello, Every.
My name is Hao Zhang, come from China.
To be honist, I don't have experice as the code engineer.
I works in the automotive industrial area and play a process engineering role. 
like machining, welding, potting....
But when I was young, I dreamed to be a code engineer.
I am already 38, never say too late.
Now, It is the time to do that!!!!!
